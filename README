Decache

-----

Decache extracts working and completely valid files from an iOS dyld shared cache.*

* Used to...it currently is built for 9.0 armv7s




Compilation:
  Link your theos directory to ./theos
  Edit the makefile to determine native (OS X) vs iphone (iOS)

Usage examples:
  To list all files in the cache
    decache -c <cache>
  To dump the entire cache
    decache -c <cache> -o <output dir>
  To dump just one file
    decache -c <cache> -x <file to extract>
    decache -c <cache> -x <file to extract> -o <output path + filename>
  
Notes:
  Wildcards are not supported.  However, decache does partial string matching (e.g. '-x UIKit')
  Do not use scp/rsync to download your cache from your device.  Use afc.  Or figure out how to use F_GLOBAL_NOCACHE.
  I do not add code signatures.
